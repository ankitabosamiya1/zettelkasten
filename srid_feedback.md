    1. We have implemented [here](https://common-neuron.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) in Neuron 0.5.3.0.
    2. It works well.
    3. It has broken link for index.html as seen in website. If you click on Ankita's Neuron, it will not work.
    4. tag does not work.
    5. We need more markdown formatting, like "*" is not working, we need all markdown support which GitHub provides.
    6. We need comment support.
    7. Sometimes link does not work as shown in point 1.
